------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview.

PECOS generates samples of random fields (RFs) and stochastic processes (SPs)
from a set of user-defined power spectral densities (PSDs).  The RF/SP may 
be either Gaussian or non-Gaussian and either stationary or nonstationary, 
and the resulting sample is intended for run-time query by parallel finite 
element simulation codes.
