Installation.

The installation procedure uses a standard GNU installation based on autoconf.
The basic steps are to invoke 'configure' to generate Makefiles for your 
particular system and then invoke 'make' to compile the sources.  See the 
INSTALL file for detailed instructions.  Support for Cmake builds are 
currently under development and will become the default in time.
